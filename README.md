## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The `AudioPillPlayer` component is a React component designed for managing and playing audio tracks. It utilizes the `react-dropzone` library for handling file drops and supports various features such as uploading, playback, pausing, and deleting audio tracks.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

### Added through Coding & Logic:
1. **Multiple Track Handling:** The component efficiently handles multiple audio tracks simultaneously.
2. **File Type Recognition and Rejection:** Recognizes and rejects files other than audio files with informative error messages.
3. **Playback Control:** Allows Play/Pause of selected audio tracks through both the audio element controls and external 'Play/Pause' buttons, ensuring synchronization.
4. **Track Deletion:** Supports the deletion of selected tracks via a dedicated 'Delete' button.
5. **Currently Playing Track Display:** Displays the name of the currently playing track on the player.
6. **Playback Resumption:** If a track is paused and playback is resumed, it continues from where it was paused, ensuring a seamless listening experience.
7. **Exclusive Pausing:** If a track is playing, only the selected track can be paused to avoid unintended disruptions.
8. **Exclusive Playing:** If a track is paused, along with others, it can be played, and no other track can be paused.
